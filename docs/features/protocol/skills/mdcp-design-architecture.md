# Design-architecture helper

Product capability: the **`mdcp-design-architecture`** helper skill records
architecture and design decisions as **MDCP shards** so agents and humans can
load one concern at a time instead of growing a single architecture monolith.

Invoke (after the parent skill is installed):

```text
/mdcp-design-architecture
```

Upstream pack: [`skills/mdcp-design-architecture/`](../../../../skills/mdcp-design-architecture/SKILL.md).
Shared helper contract (intake, guide placement, glossary): [Helper Skills](../agent-task-prompts.md).

## End-user value

Contributors find the right design note (components, contracts, ADR) in one
shard read. Architecture intent stays linked through feature and ADR indexes
instead of living only in chat or a thousand-line wiki page.

## What this helper is for

See [Atomic commit groups](../../../glossary/atomic-commit-groups.md) for the plan-field contract.

| Obligation                  | As-built expectation                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Capture architecture intent | Draft system diagrams, API/data contracts, and boundaries as shards under `docs/features/`              |
| Atomic commit groups        | Include numbered Atomic commit groups in the plan before “go”; one commit per group after approval      |
| Branch before edit          | Plan names branch + `WORK_ITEM` before “go”; branch from `main`; NEVER edit/commit on `main`/`master`   |
| Land durable decisions      | Record accepted choices as ADRs under `docs/features/adr/` when the repo uses that layout               |
| Keep docs sharded           | Prefer **one primary concern per shard**; update feature/ADR `index.md` so new shards are discoverable  |
| Brownfield hygiene          | Split or retire legacy architecture monoliths; remove superseded planning from durable design shards    |
| Stay design-doc scoped      | No product/CLI/TypeScript implementation, no unit tests as delivery, no primary `docs/client/` work     |
| Glossary hygiene            | Follow the shared glossary obligation; define non-universal design jargon per the inclusion bar         |
| Parent QA                   | Current intended architecture only; no large implementation dumps; run repo `mdcp check` / docs scripts |

Intake is the same as other work-item helpers: `WORK_ITEM` and
`WORK_ITEM_LOOKUP` before branching or editing.

## What this helper is not

- **Deep design critique / multi-option trade-off workshops** — pair with a
  separate design-thinking skill or human review, then record the agreed intent
  as shards.
- **Implementing CLI flags, packages, or unit tests** — use
  [mdcp-feature-level](./mdcp-feature-level.md).
- **End-user / client journey and workflow design** — use [mdcp-ux](./mdcp-ux.md).
- **Docs-only cleanup with no architecture change** — use
  [mdcp-doc-only](./mdcp-doc-only.md).
- **Bootstrapping MDCP in an empty or legacy repo** — use
  [mdcp-getting-started](./mdcp-getting-started.md).
- **Grading “good systems design” brilliance** — out of scope; this helper owns
  **MDCP documentation-system** behavior (sharding, indexes, design-doc scope).

When the user asks for end-to-end delivery (design + client guide + code +
tests) in one session, this helper **MUST** stay on design shards (or ask to
narrow scope) and state next steps for the other helpers.

## Acceptance (as-built)

A successful design-architecture session typically:

1. Creates or updates focused Markdown under `docs/features/` and/or `docs/features/adr/`
2. Updates the relevant guide indexes so shards link together
3. Applies glossary hygiene for any non-universal language introduced (per inclusion bar)
4. Leaves `packages/` / product `src/` unchanged
5. Avoids multi-function implementation dumps in durable shards
6. When deep design critique is requested, advises pairing and still lands the agreed intent as shards
