# MDCP 1.0 specification (draft)

Normative specification for the MarkDown Context Protocol. Parent: [GitHub #48](https://github.com/betsalel-williamson/mdcp/issues/48).

> **Status:** Draft — reference implementation leads; prose reconciled against `mdcp-core` before npm **1.0.0**. Agent entrypoint is the parent **Agent Skill** (`/mdcp`).

## 1. Introduction

MDCP defines **offline document context preparation**: shard layout, compile semantics, validation pipeline, and Agent Skill development. It does **not** define wire transport (see [Scope and positioning](./01-scope-and-positioning.md)).

Conformance keywords: **MUST**, **SHOULD**, **MAY** (RFC 2119 sense).

## 2. Default Guide Layout (Code Repository Archetype)

Conforming repositories **SHOULD** organize shards into guides listed in `compileOrder`. This default structure—often referred to as the **Code Repository Archetype**—is the "batteries-included" layout for software engineering projects:

| Guide tier | Typical path | Holds                                                                       | Keep out                                              |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Features   | `features/`  | Product capabilities, design/ADRs, contracts, acceptance criteria           | Maintainer runbooks, CI/eval loops, contributor setup |
| Client     | `client/`    | Consumer value and usage of the shipped tool                                | Internal contributor process, skill-authoring evals   |
| Developer  | `developer/` | Repo workflow, tracker integration, releases, skill development, live evals | Product capability specs or end-user tutorials        |
| Glossary   | `glossary/`  | Shared terms and disambiguation                                             | General code snippets                                 |

This four-tier taxonomy is fundamental to preventing the system from falling apart as it scales. It enforces strict boundaries that keep developer workflows out of client usage and separate high-level feature specs from low-level code. **Placement test:** if only contributors to the docs repo need the shard, put it in `developer/`; if consumers of the product need it, use `features/` or `client/`.

Each guide **MUST** have a manifest (`index.md` or `shards.md`) defining compile order.

Glossary terms **SHOULD** be one shard per entry. Large glossaries **MAY** split manifests across `index.md` and sub-index files (for example `index-protocol.md`) that link term shards; transitive manifest links include terms in compile output.

The MDCP engine itself is agnostic. Other documentation systems (e.g., Legal Operations, HR Policies) **MAY** introduce their own "battery types" (archetypes) with completely different guide tiers using the same underlying `mdcp compile` and `mdcp check` mechanics.

## 3. Agent task subagents

Helper skills are part of the MDCP 1.0 authoring profile. Activate via the skill trigger (e.g. `/mdcp-feature-level`). See [Agent helper skills](./agent-task-prompts.md).

Helper skills **MUST** collect `WORK_ITEM` and `WORK_ITEM_LOOKUP` via interactive intake before editing. Feature work **SHOULD** use [mdcp-feature-level](../../skills/mdcp-feature-level/SKILL.md).

## 4. Skills and immutability

The Agent Skills pack in a consumer docs root **MUST NOT** be hand-edited by agents for repo-specific content. Project overlays belong in `docs/extensions/` or normative shards. Extension packs and archetypes: [Extensions and archetypes](./extensions-and-archetypes.md).

## 5. Agent context delivery

Agent context comes from the parent **Agent Skill** and one-shard reads. There is no token-strip export profile — see [ADR 0001](../adr/0001-remove-export-profiles.md).
