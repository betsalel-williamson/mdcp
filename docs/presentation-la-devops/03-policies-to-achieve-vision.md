## Policies to Achieve the Vision

The bottleneck is no longer code syntax. It's our ability to accurately architect systems.

Your docs must capture:

1. **Intent and Value:** Why does this exist?
2. **User Personas:** Who is suffering without this?
3. **System Realities:** Is this a greenfield prototype, or a 30-year-old legacy system?

## Core MDCP Principles

- **Capture to the Proper Degree:** A method to ensure info supports all value chain activities.
- **High level over implementation:** Shards hold plan, constraints, and acceptance criteria; code holds _how_.
- **Glossary as first-class:** Domain terms and legacy disambiguation live in dedicated shards.
- **Document before build/migrate:** Capture context in shards before greenfield work.
- **Granular, safe context:** `refs lookup` → single shard.
- **Open standard & Extensions:** `docs/extensions/` locally; shared packs in `spec/extensions/`.
