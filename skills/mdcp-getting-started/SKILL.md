# Getting Started Helper

> **PREREQUISITE:** Follow the `mdcp` parent skill first (QA Principles, What
> belongs where). Ensure the `mdcp` CLI is installed.

Bootstrap MDCP, then optionally guide a **first feature** through the helper
skills. Day-to-day work after onboarding uses those helpers directly.

**Invoke:** `/mdcp-getting-started`

## Role

Documentation Architect: bootstrap config, guide layout, and initial shards;
then orchestrate an optional first-feature tutorial (design → feature → UX →
doc-only). Adapt teaching depth to **EXPERIENCE**.

**Bootstrap out of scope:** inventing TDD rituals or atomic commit grouping
during scaffold only — day-to-day helpers own those when the tutorial runs.

## Intake (ask before editing)

Ask for missing values; wait; do not invent. Skip only if already provided.

1. **FEATURE** — feature or project name for initial docs
2. **PERSONA** — primary audience for the client / end-user guide
3. **EXPERIENCE**
   - **novice** — first skill / unsure about Markdown → tutorial shards + short
     concept pauses
   - **expert** — read the docs / automating → concise scaffold; no lectures

After bootstrap succeeds, ask tutorial intake (see
[references/first-feature-tutorial.md](references/first-feature-tutorial.md)):

4. **RUN_FIRST_FEATURE_TUTORIAL** — yes/skip (default **yes** for novice)
5. **EXAMPLE_MODE** — **recommended** (`hello-greeting`) or **bring-your-own**

## Process

### 1. Inspect (greenfield vs brownfield)

Discover package manager and existing docs before editing.

- **Greenfield** — no meaningful docs tree → scaffold cleanly.
- **Brownfield** — legacy docs exist:
  - Do **not** delete or overwrite legacy files.
  - Scaffold the four-tier MDCP layout **alongside** them.
  - Pull useful content into new shards.
  - Mark each migrated legacy file **ready to archive after review** (banner).
    Never auto-delete.

### 2. Install

Add `@bwilliamson/mdcp-cli` and `@bwilliamson/mdcp-presets` with this repo's
package manager. Optional peers only if needed: `markdownlint-cli2`, `prettier`,
`vale` (on `PATH`; `.vale.ini` + `vale sync`).

### 3. Config and scripts

Add `mdcp.config.json` under the docs root (`compileOrder`, guides, lint paths).
Wire `mdcp compile` / `mdcp check` into the script runner. CI with optional
linters: `--require-lint` / `--require-vale`.

### 4. Guide layout

- `docs/glossary/` — one term per shard; index lists terms; link from guides
- `docs/features/` — capabilities, design, contracts
- `docs/developer/` — setup, layout, validation
- `docs/client/` — end-user guide; `about-this-guide.md` states **PERSONA**

Each guide needs `index.md` + topic shards. Never hand-edit generated compile
output or `refs.json`.

**Glossary inclusion bar:** With the end user, record in the glossary (typically
the `docs/glossary/index.md` preamble) which terms do / do not belong for this
project — whose understanding counts (PERSONA and/or contributors), examples of
in/out terms, and the preference when unsure (short entry vs omit). This is a
project judgment call, not a universal list. Day-to-day helpers must follow it.

### 5. Experience-adaptive content

| EXPERIENCE | Do                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **novice** | Tutorial shards (what a shard is, why compile/check); brief concept pauses; FEATURE/PERSONA starters |
| **expert** | Minimal FEATURE starters only; no tutorial/onboarding lecture shards                                 |

Seed domain terms that meet the inclusion bar; one `.md` per term + index.

### 6. Validate

`mdcp compile` then `mdcp check` until clean. After cross-links, re-check;
fragments must match **compiled** output (`mdcp refs list` if needed).

### 7. First feature tutorial (optional)

Follow [references/first-feature-tutorial.md](references/first-feature-tutorial.md):

1. Offer the walkthrough (`RUN_FIRST_FEATURE_TUTORIAL`).
2. Resolve `EXAMPLE_MODE` (recommended `hello-greeting` or bring-your-own).
3. Run phases in order, loading each helper’s Process:
   design-architecture → feature-level → ux → doc-only.
4. Pause for “go” between phases; `mdcp check` before advancing.
5. Deliver the [Closing CTA](references/first-feature-tutorial.md#closing-cta)
   (star, review, share, DORA capabilities, [dora.community/join](https://dora.community/join)).

If the user skips the tutorial, hand off to the matching day-to-day helper and
still offer the Closing CTA briefly.
