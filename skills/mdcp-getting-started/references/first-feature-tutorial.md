# First feature tutorial

Run this **after** bootstrap (`mdcp compile` / `mdcp check` clean). Same
session; do not invent a parallel workflow — **load and follow** each helper
skill’s Process contract.

## Offer and EXAMPLE_MODE

1. Ask whether to run the **First feature tutorial**.
   - **novice** — default **yes**
   - **expert** — may skip
2. If **skip**: brief handoff to day-to-day helpers, then run [Closing CTA](#closing-cta) once.
3. If **yes**, ask **EXAMPLE_MODE**:
   - **recommended** — use [`hello-greeting`](#recommended-example-hello-greeting)
   - **bring-your-own** — user names FEATURE (and PERSONA if different); keep
     one small shippable slice

Set tutorial `WORK_ITEM` from the chosen example. Prefer
`WORK_ITEM_LOOKUP` = a `docs/developer/` shard when the repo has agent
work-item tracking; otherwise use the conversation + starter shards.

## Phase order

Pause for user “go” between phases. One concern per phase. Run `mdcp check`
before advancing. Atomic commit groups apply **inside** each day-to-day helper
(not during pure bootstrap).

| Phase | Helper                     | Focus                                                |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | `mdcp-design-architecture` | Architecture / ADR shards under `docs/features/`     |
| 2     | `mdcp-feature-level`       | Docs-first, then TDD for the slice                   |
| 3     | `mdcp-ux`                  | Client journey / end-user value under `docs/client/` |
| 4     | `mdcp-doc-only`            | Polish: glossary, indexes, consistency               |

For each phase: open the matching installed skill under `.agents/skills/` (or
`skills/`), complete that helper’s intake if values are missing, follow its
Process, validate, then announce the next phase.

## Recommended example: hello-greeting

Tiny greeting capability — one user-facing outcome, minimal surface.

| Field    | Value                                                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FEATURE  | `hello-greeting`                                                        |
| PERSONA  | Developers who want a one-line greeting from the library or CLI         |
| Outcome  | Something callable returns a short greeting string (e.g. `Hello, MDCP`) |
| Design   | One capability shard (and optional short ADR) — no large system design  |
| Feature  | Docs + minimal implementation + tests against acceptance criteria       |
| UX       | Client guide: how PERSONA runs or calls the greeting                    |
| Doc-only | Glossary/index polish; remove stale bootstrap placeholders              |
