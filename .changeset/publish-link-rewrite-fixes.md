'@bwilliamson/mdcp-core': patch

Split intra-guide and publish-path link rewriting: intra-guide `./section.md` links rewrite on every compile; `compile.publishPathRewrite` drives repo-root path rewrites for publish outputs. Fix `compileGuides` to return an empty string when all guides have `outputFile`. Export `GuideConfigInput`, `MdcpConfigInput`, and `CompileOptionsInput`.
