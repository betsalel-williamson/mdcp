'@bwilliamson/mdcp-cli': patch
---

Restructure the published npm README for LLM-first adoption.

The compiled `packages/mdcp-cli/README.md` now opens with a value proposition for coding agents, the copy-paste bootstrap prompt (within the first ~80 lines), and follow-up prompt templates. Install, config, and command reference content is unchanged but moved below agent onboarding.

**What changed:** shard order in `docs/client-cli/` — new `why-mdcp-for-agents.md` opening shard; `llm-collaboration.md` leads with bootstrap and follow-up prompts; glossary and reference sections compile later in the README.

**Old behavior that no longer applies:** the npm README previously opened with install/quick start and placed the bootstrap prompt ~370 lines down under LLM collaboration. Deep links to `#llm-collaboration` still resolve; the bootstrap anchor is now `#bootstrap-prompt-copy-paste` near the top.
