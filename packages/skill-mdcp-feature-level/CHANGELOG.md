# @bwilliamson/skill-mdcp-feature-level

## 0.7.2

### Patch Changes

- d60f90d: Move skill version carriers and CHANGELOGs to packages/skill-* so npx skills add installs stay free of release metadata; publish skill notes on GitHub Releases in the same single-step main release job as npm packages.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 6d2e640: Document skill install paths as host-agnostic: `npx skills` places skills in each agent's directory (not only `.agents/skills/`).
- e017c43: Version packages and Agent Skills independently via Changesets; release on merge to main through the Version Packages PR. Major bumps stay blocked until maintainers open 1.0.
